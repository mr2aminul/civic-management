# File Manager Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. HTTP 500 Error on Download
**Problem**: The download endpoint was causing HTTP 500 errors due to header issues.

**Solution**:
- Removed `header_remove()` call before `fm_stream_file_download()`
- The function now properly sets headers and streams the file

### 2. Direct File Links (R2 vs Local)
**Problem**: Preview and download were always using the local path, not checking if files were available in R2 CDN.

**Solution**:
- Added new endpoint `get_file_url` to check file location
- Created helper function `fm_get_file_url()` that:
  - Checks if file exists in R2 storage (by querying `fm_files` table)
  - Returns CDN URL if file is uploaded to R2 and `r2_domain` is configured
  - Falls back to local path indicator if file is only local
- Updated `downloadFile()` and `openPreview()` functions to use the new API
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Files in R2 serve directly from CDN, saving VPS bandwidth
- **Cost Optimization**: Only uses R2 API when needed, reduces R2 operations cost

### 3. Multiple File Selection and Deletion
**Problem**: Right-click delete on multiple selected files only deleted one file.

**Solution**:
- Updated context menu to show "Delete (N)" when multiple files are selected
- Modified `delete_local` endpoint to accept `paths[]` array for batch deletion
- Updated context menu handler to properly send all selected files
- Fixed Delete key handler to use batch delete API

### 4. Drag Selection Text Selection Issue
**Problem**: Dragging mouse to select files was also selecting text on the page.

**Solution**:
- Added `isDragging` flag to track drag state
- Implemented `selectstart` event prevention during drag
- Added mousedown/mouseup handlers on content area
- Prevents text selection while allowing normal file interactions

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness
**Problem**: UI was not properly responsive on mobile devices.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced mobile CSS with:
  - Responsive grid layouts (110px minimum on mobile)
  - Smaller font sizes and padding
  - 2-column stats grid on mobile
  - Hidden columns in list view on small screens
  - Flexible header with wrapping search bar
  - Responsive modal with 95% width
  - Touch-friendly button sizes
- Added sidebar mobile support (can be toggled)
- Improved context menu sizing for mobile

### 6. Touch Device Support
**Problem**: Touch events were not properly handled.

**Solution**:
- All click handlers work with touch events (jQuery handles this automatically)
- Context menu positioning accounts for scroll position
- Checkbox interactions work on touch devices
- Drag-and-drop file upload works on modern touch devices

### 7. Recycle Bin Feature Indicator
**Problem**: Users didn't know recycle bin was not yet implemented.

**Solution**:
- Added "Coming Soon" badge next to Recycle Bin in sidebar
- Removed the alert popup (cleaner UX)
- Visual indicator in yellow/amber color

### 8. API Setup Link for Admins
**Problem**: No easy way for admins to access API configuration.

**Solution**:
- Added "Settings" section in sidebar
- Created "API Setup" link with gear icon (visible only to admins)
- Links to `manage/file_manager?tab=settings` page

## API Endpoints Modified

### New Endpoint
- `GET/POST get_file_url` - Returns file location (R2 or local) and CDN URL if available

### Modified Endpoints
- `POST delete_local` - Now accepts `paths[]` array for batch deletion
- `GET download_local` - Removed header_remove() call for proper streaming

## New Functions

### `fm_get_file_url($relativePath)`
Located in: `assets/includes/file_manager_helper.php`

Checks if a file is available in R2 storage and returns:
- `location`: 'r2', 'local', or 'none'
- `url`: CDN URL if in R2, null otherwise

## Files Modified

1. `/xhr/file_manager.php` - API endpoints
2. `/assets/includes/file_manager_helper.php` - Helper functions
3. `/manage/pages/file_manager/content.phtml` - UI and JavaScript

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test file download with files stored locally
2. Test file download with files stored in R2 (should use CDN URL)
3. Test multiple file selection and deletion
4. Test on mobile devices (responsive layout)
5. Test touch interactions on tablets
6. Verify "Coming Soon" badge appears for Recycle Bin
7. Verify "API Setup" link appears only for admins
8. Test drag selection doesn't select text

## Performance Improvements

- **Bandwidth**: Files in R2 serve directly from CDN, bypassing VPS
- **R2 Costs**: Only queries R2 when necessary, reduces API calls
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple deletions in one request reduces overhead
- **Mobile**: Optimized layouts reduce rendering time on mobile devices
