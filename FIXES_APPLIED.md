# File Manager & Backup System - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Functions in file_manager_helper.php

**Problem:** The `xhr/file_manager.php` was calling functions that didn't exist in `file_manager_helper.php`:
- `fm_get_local_dir()`
- `fm_save_uploaded_local()`
- `fm_list_local_folder()`
- `fm_get_file_info()`
- `fm_delete_local_recursive()`
- `fm_list_r2_cached()`
- `fm_get_pending_uploads()`
- `fm_process_upload_queue_worker()`
- `fm_create_db_dump()`
- `fm_create_table_dump()`
- `fm_restore_sql_gz_local()`
- `fm_enforce_retention()`
- `fm_cache_get/set/delete()`

**Fix:** Added all missing functions to `file_manager_helper.php` (lines 715-1050)

### 2. Missing 'get_env' Endpoint

**Problem:** The frontend was calling `?f=file_manager&s=get_env` but this action wasn't defined in `xhr/file_manager.php`

**Fix:** Added `get_env` case to the switch statement (line 228-234) that returns:
```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "r2_configured": true/false,
  "local_storage": "/path/to/storage"
}
```

### 3. Missing Configuration in .env

**Problem:** The `.env` file was incomplete and missing critical configuration values

**Fix:** Added all required environment variables to `.env`:
- R2 credentials (ACCESS_KEY_ID, SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, BUCKET, ENDPOINT, DOMAIN)
- Database credentials (HOST, USER, PASSWORD, NAME)
- Storage directories
- Auto-upload settings
- Retention policies

### 4. Configuration Key Mismatch

**Problem:** `xhr/file_manager.php` was using `auto_upload_exts` but `fm_get_config()` only returned `auto_upload_types`

**Fix:** Added both keys to config array (line 44) so both work interchangeably

### 5. AWS SDK Path Issue

**Problem:** The helper was trying to load AWS SDK from a hardcoded path that might not exist

**Fix:** Added fallback paths (lines 7-11):
1. First tries: `assets/libraries/aws-sdk-php/vendor/autoload.php`
2. Falls back to: `vendor/autoload.php` (project root)

### 6. Syntax Issues in upload_local Handler

**Problem:** Missing braces and inconsistent formatting in conditional blocks

**Fix:** Cleaned up the conditional logic (lines 78-89) with proper braces

## Files Modified

1. **assets/includes/file_manager_helper.php**
   - Added 335 lines of missing functions
   - Fixed AWS SDK loading with fallback
   - Added cache system functions

2. **xhr/file_manager.php**
   - Added `get_env` endpoint
   - Fixed syntax in `upload_local` case
   - Cleaned up conditional logic

3. **.env**
   - Added R2 credentials
   - Added database configuration
   - Added all required environment variables

## Files Created

1. **SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md** - Complete installation and setup guide
2. **test-file-manager.php** - Diagnostic script to verify installation
3. **FIXES_APPLIED.md** - This document

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Install AWS SDK

The system requires AWS SDK for PHP to connect to Cloudflare R2:

```bash
cd /home/civicbd/civicgroup
composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
```

### 2. Run Database Migration

Create all required tables:

```bash
mysql -u civicbd_civicgroup -p civicbd_civicgroup < migrations/001_file_manager_and_backup_system.sql
```

### 3. Create Required Directories

```bash
mkdir -p /home/civicbd/civicgroup/storage
mkdir -p /home/civicbd/civicgroup/backups
chmod 755 /home/civicbd/civicgroup/storage
chmod 755 /home/civicbd/civicgroup/backups
```

### 4. Test the System

Run the diagnostic script:
```
https://civicgroupbd.com/test-file-manager.php
```

Or test API endpoints:
```bash
curl "https://civicgroupbd.com/requests.php?f=file_manager&s=ping"
curl "https://civicgroupbd.com/requests.php?f=file_manager&s=get_env"
```

## Remaining Issues to Check

1. **AWS SDK Installation** - Composer package needs to be installed
2. **Database Tables** - Migration needs to be run
3. **Directory Permissions** - Storage/backup folders need proper permissions
4. **R2 Connection** - Verify R2 credentials work and bucket is accessible

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] AWS SDK installed
- [ ] Database tables created
- [ ] Storage directories exist and are writable
- [ ] R2 connection working
- [ ] Upload files locally
- [ ] List local files
- [ ] Create folders
- [ ] Delete files
- [ ] Upload to R2
- [ ] Create database backup
- [ ] Process upload queue

## Error Logs to Check

If issues persist, check these logs:

1. PHP error log: `/var/log/php-fpm/error.log`
2. Apache/Nginx error log: `/var/log/apache2/error.log` or `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
3. Application logs in database: `fm_activity_log` table

## Support

For issues:
1. Run diagnostic: `https://civicgroupbd.com/test-file-manager.php`
2. Check error logs
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Ensure AWS SDK is installed
5. Confirm database tables exist
