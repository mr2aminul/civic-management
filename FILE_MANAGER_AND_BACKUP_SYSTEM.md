## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Execute the migration SQL file to create all necessary tables:

```bash
mysql -u your_user -p your_database < migrations/001_file_manager_and_backup_system.sql
```

Or via phpMyAdmin: Import the file `migrations/001_file_manager_and_backup_system.sql`

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file (they're already present):

```env
# Storage Directories
LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR=/home/civicbd/civicgroup/storage
DB_BACKUP_LOCAL_DIR=/home/civicbd/civicgroup/backups

# R2 Configuration
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=2c3443e44db2a753265134fbe0a65f67
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=d24621ce0729f68776d155a3ead711679c249baafffd5a5dc581ddcf185d786e
R2_BUCKET=civic-management
R2_ENDPOINT=https://90f483339efd91e1a8819e04ba6e31e6.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_ENDPOINT_DOMAIN=https://cdn.civicgroubd.com

# Quotas & Settings
DEFAULT_USER_QUOTA_GB=1
AUTO_UPLOAD_TYPES=sql,zip,xlsx,docx,pdf
AUTO_UPLOAD_PREFIXES=db_,sys_
RECYCLE_RETENTION_DAYS=30
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Database Connection (for backups)
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

### Step 3: Set Up Cron Job for Automated Backups

Add this to your crontab (`crontab -e`):

```cron
# Run backup every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/project/cron-backup.php >> /var/log/backup-cron.log 2>&1

# Process R2 upload queue every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/project/cron-upload-queue.php >> /var/log/upload-queue.log 2>&1

# Clean recycle bin daily
0 2 * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/your/project/cron-cleanup.php >> /var/log/cleanup.log 2>&1
```

### Step 4: Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p /home/civicbd/civicgroup/storage
mkdir -p /home/civicbd/civicgroup/backups
chmod 755 /home/civicbd/civicgroup/storage
chmod 755 /home/civicbd/civicgroup/backups
chown www-data:www-data /home/civicbd/civicgroup/storage
chown www-data:www-data /home/civicbd/civicgroup/backups
```

## Database Schema

4. **fm_recycle_bin** - Deleted files with 30-day retention
5. **fm_upload_queue** - Queue for R2 uploads
6. **backup_logs** - Backup operation history
7. **backup_schedules** - Automated backup schedules

## Features Detailed

### 1. User Quotas

Each user has:
- Default quota: 1GB (configurable via `DEFAULT_USER_QUOTA_GB`)
- Automatic quota tracking on upload/delete
- Quota exceeded prevention
- Admin can adjust user quotas in database

### 2. Recycle Bin

- Files moved to recycle bin on delete (not permanently deleted)
- 30-day retention period (configurable via `RECYCLE_RETENTION_DAYS`)
- Auto-cleanup via cron job
- Users can restore their own files
- Admins can force-delete files immediately
- Quota is freed only after permanent deletion

### 3. Global Folders

- Created by default: "Shared Documents", "Company Resources", "Templates"
- Visible to all users
- Any user can upload to global folders
- Admins can create more global folders

### 4. R2 Storage Integration

- Automatic upload for configured file types (sql, zip, xlsx, docx, pdf)
- Automatic upload for files with configured prefixes (db_, sys_)
- Queue-based upload system (non-blocking)
- Upload queue processed by cron every 15 minutes
- File availability indicator showing R2 status

### 5. File Editing

Supports inline editing for:
- **Text files**: .txt, .log, .php, .js, .css, .html, .json, .md, .sql
- **Spreadsheets**: .xlsx, .xls, .csv (view and edit)
- **Images**: Preview with viewer

### 6. Automated Backups

- Full database backup every 6 hours
- Automatic upload to R2
- 30-day retention with auto-cleanup
- Backup logs with status tracking
- Email notifications on failure (optional)

### 7. Table-wise Backup & Restore

- Backup individual tables
- Restore individual tables without affecting other data
- Useful for selective data recovery
- Test restores to verify backup integrity

## Usage Examples

### For Regular Users:

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Navigate to File Manager
   - Drag & drop files or click Upload button
   - Files are automatically organized

2. **Create Folders**:
   - Click "Create Folder" button
   - Enter folder name
   - Folder is created in current location

3. **Delete Files**:
   - Right-click file â†’ Delete
   - File moves to Recycle Bin
   - Restore within 30 days if needed

4. **Check Quota**:
   - Quota displayed in sidebar
   - Shows used / total storage

### For Administrators:

1. **Create Backup**:
   - Go to Backup Manager
   - Click "Create Full Backup"
   - Backup auto-uploads to R2

2. **Table Backup**:
   - Select "Table Backup"
   - Choose table from list
   - Backup specific table

3. **Restore Database**:
   - View backup list
   - Click "Restore" on desired backup
   - Confirm restoration
   - Database is restored

4. **Manage User Quotas**:
   - Edit `fm_user_quotas` table
   - Update `quota_bytes` for specific user
   - Changes take effect immediately

## Security Considerations

1. **File Upload Validation**:
   - All filenames are sanitized
   - File types are checked
   - Size limits enforced via quotas

2. **Permission Checks**:
   - Users can only access their own files
   - Global folders accessible to all
   - Admin-only operations protected

3. **R2 Security**:
   - All R2 uploads use private ACL
   - Access via signed URLs only
   - Credentials stored in environment variables

4. **Database Backups**:
   - Credentials stored securely in temp files
   - Temp files deleted after use
   - Backups compressed with gzip

## Troubleshooting

### Backups Not Creating:
- Check `mysqldump` is installed: `which mysqldump`
- Verify database credentials in `.env`
- Check backup directory permissions
- Review backup logs in database

### R2 Uploads Failing:
- Verify R2 credentials in `.env`
- Check S3 SDK is installed: `composer require aws/aws-sdk-php`
- Test R2 connectivity
- Review upload queue table for errors

### Quota Not Updating:
- Check `fm_user_quotas` table exists
- Verify triggers are working
- Manually recalculate: Run quota sync script

### Cron Jobs Not Running:
- Verify cron is enabled: `systemctl status cron`
- Check cron logs: `/var/log/syslog`
- Ensure PHP CLI is accessible
- Verify script paths are correct

## Advanced Configuration

### Adjust Backup Frequency:

Edit `backup_schedules` table:
```sql
UPDATE backup_schedules
SET frequency_hours = 12,
    next_run_at = DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 12 HOUR)
WHERE schedule_name = 'Auto Full Backup';
```

### Change User Default Quota:

```env
DEFAULT_USER_QUOTA_GB=5
```

Or per-user:
```sql
UPDATE fm_user_quotas SET quota_bytes = 5368709120 WHERE user_id = 123;
```

### Add Auto-upload File Types:

```env
AUTO_UPLOAD_TYPES=sql,zip,xlsx,docx,pdf,mp4,mov
```

## Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly:
- Review backup logs for failures
- Check disk space on backup directory
- Verify R2 storage costs

### Monthly:
- Review and archive old backups
- Audit user quota usage
- Clean up orphaned files

### Quarterly:
- Test database restore procedure
- Review and update retention policies
- Security audit of file permissions
